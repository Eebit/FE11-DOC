## Faces

### Dialogue Faces

Contained in `/data/f/` directory.

Entire files are compressed with FEDS compression/encoding

After decompressing:
- Palette data is first 0x200 bytes
- Rest is img data

There's a "faces.bin" which contains the FIDs and some pointers, not sure what else yet

### Stat Screen Faces

Portraits for the stat screen are located in "/data/sf/" (stat face? small face?)

".p" files are palette data, uncompressed

Each sf file is compressed perhaps differently :( Tiki is 0x40 FEDS, Caeda is 0x10 LZ10 compressed

Compression schemes!
0x10 is LZ10
0x11 is LZ11
0x28 is huffman?
0x30 is NitroGfx's RL
0x40 is FEDS Nintenlord decompression
